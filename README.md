This is a simple python based hash verifier to maintain the integrity of the file you just downloaded from The "Internet".
currently by the date of this upload (20-10-2024) the program only has 2 hashing algorithms which are mainly used in hashing a file SHA-256 and MD5.
anyone intrested in collaborating on this and updating the project is welcomed!!
